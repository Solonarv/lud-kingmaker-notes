we sleep

very deep in the night, we're woken up by the sound of a guard crying out.

we hastily put on/gather our gear, except ducim because there's not enough time (only a minute).
Aerwynn puts on his jewelry with surprising speed
three cutthroats outside our room! enter encounter mode!

aerwynn passes ducim an elixir of life (minor). a very thin crystal vial with a stopper shaped like an elven god. as soon as ducim finishes drinking it, the crystal vial vanishes.

a series of booms echoes through the building: interior portcullises sealing off the upper floor.

we decide to go check it out.

??? (i was absent)

we check the cutthroats' stuff. they have 5 sp each plus equipment. veris takes the silver and one of their daggers.

we start going from room to room.
![](../Pasted%20image%2020230129215134.png)
we start in the top right (room 0), numbering counterclockwise.

room 1 (ducim): beds soaked with blood, human hand on the floor. line of blood leads from the room to door west. under one of the beds is a tanglefoot bag and a longsword. ducim takes the bag.

room 2 (veris): 5 corpses. (halfling, other common ancestries). he finds a minor healing potion under the halfling's pillow.

ducim takes the time to don his armor properly.

room 5 (aerwynn): 5 corpses 2 f human, 1 m human, 1 m dwarf, 1 m elf.

room 4 (izaya): empty, bloodstains. izaya searches more closely, finds nothing

room 3: empty

we leave following bloodstains, through the door to the water gardens

BTC1 stride away (fleeing), trigger ducim AOO, 25 crit for 17 s.
encounter end. 80 xp(?)

garden's very pretty. tropical indoor forest, styled after Mwangi jungle. life-size statue of an elven woman holding a rose and wielding a shield. Aerwynn recognizes her: melani, lady aldori's patron goddess.
veris downs the healing potion he found earlier (+5 hp)
izaya heals (2a, +13 hp) ducim.
we hear more noises from ahead. heavy steps, roaring voice. "I can't see no more. where are you, halfling?" from a nearby room.

we open the door
hulking ogre! in the middle of this modest-sized library. heap of books piled up alongside severed arms&legs. ogre is severly hurt, seems to be blinded. Linzi is hiding behind a chair on the outer wall, dead quiet.
we decide to attack the ogre.
![](../Pasted%20image%2020230129222707.png)
aerwynn: ray of frost, 13 miss; shield
izaya: stride into range, faerie dust (succeeds save), demoralize (25 crit)
ducim: step, strike: 24 hit for 11 s, 13 miss
linzi: inspire courage, TK projectile: 24 hit for 8
ogre: 2a scratch himself, strike ducim: 25 hit for 10 p
veris: stride, stratagem (incl. RK: ???): nat 1, 
aerwynn: ray of frost, 17 hit for 6 cold; shield
izaya: electric arc, critfail for 10 lightning, dead.

talk to linzi. she seems to have a better idea than we do of what's happening: they're from a criminal syndicate, the Black Tears, trying to invade a castle for some reason. She's not sure what the reason is. She was briefly alerted; they have some frost giant thing going on, but they're an upcoming gang over from Port Ice. trades: kidnapping, extortion, assassination, selling illicit substances. motto: live free or slaughter.
Izaya recruits linzi to help us as we sweep through the building for more trouble.
veris pokes through the books for anything interesting, finds nothing.

Izaya opens the door she was standing in front of. large room, two rows of simple beds, small wooden chest at the front of each. 14 beds, 5 still holding the bloody corpses of murdered servants.

Veris checks another door: small room, comfortably furnished. bed, wooden chair, upturned chest with discarded personal items. no corpses, no bloodstains. he guesses: head servant's quarters? probably took something valuable from their chest and fled. or they were abducted.
we take some time to treat ducim's wounds and refocus.
veris doesn't succeed on treat wounds, but feeds a quick elixir of life to ducim instead.

we go through the door to the next section and find a (pretty small, actually) frost giant
![](../Pasted%20image%2020230129225701.png)
linzi casts inspire courage, soothe on ducim for 8 hp
giant: chill breath (izaya, veris, aerwynn; all fail, 6 cold); step closer; fist strike veris: 18 hit for 12 B, down.
ducim: strike 18 hit for 6 S, strike 7 critmiss, strike 16 miss.
izaya: heal veris (2a, 10 hp), demoralize 18 fail.
aerwynn: electric arc, fail for 6 lightning
round 2
linzi: inspire courage again, TK proj giant: 18 hit for 5
veris: stand, stride away, draw shortbow
giant: strike fist ducim x3: 15 miss, 22 hit for 15 b, , 7 miss.
ducim: strike 20 hit for 5 S, strike 17 hit for 9 S (dead).

ducim goes through the giant's stuff. we go through the door. the giant is surrounded by dead guards/soldiers.

we find amiri, valerie, harrim, unconscious in a side room. not wearing armor except for amiri.

veris (valerie), izaya (harrim), and aerwynn (amiri) treat the other adventurers' wounds, reviving them.

we exchange reports on what happened so far. they got separated. they're weak and will barricade themselves in their room to rest. we shall continue to make sure lady aldori (the most obvious target) is alright.

we shout through the door (leads to main hall, barricaded). answer: giant dead? yeah. they let us through.

blue turban guy (seen at the feast) is there, along with a half-dozen guards.
great hall very different from how it looked during the feast.
three tables turned up to barricade main door.
broken goblets, dishes, stains.
broken bodies lined up against the east wall.
tapestries torn off and wedged into corners to keep smoke from the burning west wing out.

we give a report
black throat: desperate or paid very well, probably. this is a very bold move.
lady aldori took a squad of 8 guards to clear the west wing. we might find her in the dueling hall at the end of the west wing.
we take 10 minutes to patch up some of our wound before pressing on.

we enter the west wing and immediately notice: billowing smoke, flames flickering in the doorways on both sides.
veris manages to run through while holding his breath.
aerwynn inhales some smoke; he's sickened 1 and takes 2 nonlethal damage.
izaya also inhales smoke; she's sickened 2 and takes 4 nonlethal (ow).
ducim makes it through just fine.

Izaya and Aerwynn spend some time retching and coughing, and recover from the smoke inhalation.

lying on the floor is tartuccio, the gnome. this room is a gallery filled with beautiful portraits and pieces of art. Aerwynn wakes him up. he's coughing and spluttering. thanks us, his "loyal henchmen". He demands we escort him back to the great hall at once, but we refuse; he can come with us or wait here. He chooses to wait.

Veris feeds Ducim another elixir of life (+3 hp).

Veris goes first, into the pool room. there's two cutthroats, a tall human male dual-wielding stuff, and the edgy elf lady from the feast. She's bound and gagged.
![](../Pasted%20image%2020230130001400.png)

round 2.
izaya: stride in, electric arc nishkiv (fail, 5 lightning)
veris: stratagem nishkiv, strike 25 for 7 P.

Veris rifles through Nishkiv's corpse. He has 6 daggers, leather armor, and 3 lesser healing potions. Ducim drinks one, as does Aerwynn.
Izaya cuts elf lady free. Says she overheard their boss saying Lady Aldori was cornered in the dueling pit with two giants. She's shaken/rattled.

we move on to the next room: a trophy room, with the heads of various reptilian monsters, an oversized owl, a big wolf

we get in position and open the doors to the dueling pit. veris and aerwynn pre-cast shield.
we enter. lady jamandi aldori is in a dueling pit, fighting two undersized frost giants by herself. corpses of several black tears and dead ogres on the floor.
also, a woman in her late 20s with auburn hair crooked scar on chin missing part of ear
four black tear cutthroats
lady aldori points out the woman as their leader, tells us to take her out while she deals with these two oafs (the giants).
![](../Pasted%20image%2020230130004751.png)

We're all down, but the Black Tears have better things to do than go around slitting our throats when Lady Aldori is going beastmode. note: this was a 160 xp (extreme) encounter.

total xp now: 660
