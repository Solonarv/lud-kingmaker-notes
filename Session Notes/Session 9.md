we recall some things about mitflits

a kind of gremlin fae, lost most of their ancestral magic.
natural weakness to cold iron, since they're fae
they speak undercommon (none of us do)
those few who still retain a connection to the First World often swear allegiance to the Lantern King, an elder deity of laughter, mischief, and transmutation - aka the Laughing Lie.

Ducim's longsword is already cold iron.

We set off to [GB 8 - Sootscale Cave](../Places/Stolen%20Lands/Greenbelt/GB%208%20-%20Sootscale%20Cave.md) for our meeting.
## Pharast 26
we arrive at the sootscale cave once more, and go in.
we're hailed by a kobold. veris tells them we were sent by maduk, and we do indeed come to destroy mitflits.
we're taken to talk to chief sootscale. as we traverse the caves, we notice that they're a bit small for us, but we can manage.
in the center is a dark kobold wearing a bone helmet adorned w/ feathers,leaves. worried expression.
veris greets the chief, who responds in common: tall folk. i assume you've come into our home for a good reason.
we tell him of our encoutner at the moon radish field
tribe used to be strong, but ever since curse, not so good.
> before we can take back our home, i need you to do a favor: (he approaches) since a few weeks ago, i dont have much power here. what happened is, we lost our statue, which holds our patron god Old Sharptooth. since then, this other kobold - purple - arrogant - started claiming he can speak with old sharptooth. he uses magic as though he had power from sharptooth, but there's something odd. he got here only a few weeks ago and practically controls the tribe now. he's unlike us, purple (note: the rest of the tribe is a sooty, dark color). He calls himself tartuk. He's an odd thing. I need a statue of Old Sharptooth in order to reclaim my tribe and solve this issue.

we ask: where is this statue? in the gremlins' stolen den. they just need the statue; once they have the favor of their god again, they can organize their tribe again to resettle the old sycamore tree.

we ask: how did they take the statue? they snuck in with gremlin magics, stole it, and got away.

tartuk showed up at the same time as a new lot of fancy,nice,rich tallfolk; shortly before the gremlins took the statue. we put our heads together: probably tartuccio's group. actually he's probably tartuk.

before we go - chief sootscale, can you tell us more about old sharptooth? yes, follow me. we do, to an alcove; walls smeared with charcoal-and-blood pictures of a looming sharp-toothed creature, almost devilish. two rocks one stained w/blood, one w/charcoal. elphira recalls: something familiar about the coloration, the reptilian shapes, the looong horns. not quite sure what it is though. a bit dragonlike, but standing like a humanoid? wide black wings, red coloration, very long horns. Old Sharptooth is ancestral god, their patron for as long as their oral tradition remembers. they've loyally worshipped him for generations. he has blessed them in exchange for coloring their scales and demanding tribute. through the statue, they spoke to him and managed properly keep their portion of the pact. without the statue, a curse has befallen them. the blessing doesn't do anything concrete, just general fortune (or misfortune, now that it's gone).
Elphira pledges alliance in the name of her god of vengeance.
summing it up: they can't give worship, and without worship they have nothing.
1 more question: what sort of tribute? coal from the caves, blood of their enemies.

he asks: what will we do with the mitflits? fight them on the way, but we're not out to murder them.

we decide that we should talk to tartuk aka tartuccio before we go. chief sootscale is suspicios; izaya explains that we were assigned to this region by the same group, and asked to cooperate. plus we want to know what his reasons are. he acquiesces.

tartuk's guards let us in, but turn the chief away.

we confront him with his identity as Tartuccio; he plays coy. Izaya shows him the brooch Tartuccio gave her, but he doesn't seem to recognize it.

Izaya explains who Tartuccio is and why we think this guy might be him. he says that he doesn't know tartuccio, but he sounds like a very distinguished fellow with an excellent fashion sense.

Izaya asks Tartuk if he could pass on a message, just in case he runs into Tartuccio. He agrees. he has a journal? with a quill pen? anyway. message: remember lady aldori told us to work together. we're at oleg's trading post, you can come talk to us or leave a message there so we don't step on each other's toes.

he advises we eliminate as many of those mitflits as we can while we're busy recovering the ("my") statue. izaya: any reason in particular? tartuk: they're the enemies of my tribe, and I do want what's best for my tribe.

izaya: oh, do you know where the statue might be? sootscale: they've gone back and forth between getting it and losing it and getting it again. as far as he know, the statue is in the war room, in the center of the underground complex beneath the tree.

this time, we get out through the front entrance. on the way, we see a mitflit in a cell.
## Pharast 27
we arrive at the sycamore tree and start climbing down. we reach area 1

two mitflits here, 3 tiny workbenches in the center. they're working, building something. between them, they're using a mini catapult to fire marbles at each other's open mouths. they notice us when izaya misses a step, skids a bit, and makes some noise. they shriek. combat!
