We make our pending purchases from the previous session.
## Pharast 17, 4710
we set off again
## Pharast 19
we arrive in GB 1 and poke around, and fail to spot a trap!
it has +14 attack and hits for 2d10+7. Only Izaya doesn't get hit.

in a small glade. spike snare with extra wooden spikes that clamp on.

these might belong to the dead woodsman from [GB 2 - Dead Woodsman](../Places/Stolen%20Lands/Greenbelt/GB%202%20-%20Dead%20Woodsman.md)

we take some time to heal up with lay on hands (Izaya) and treat wounds (veris)

there are hides and other traps
## Pharast 20
GB 2 again, nothing new here
## Pharast 21
[GB 6 - Temple of the Elk](../Places/Stolen%20Lands/Greenbelt/GB%206%20-%20Temple%20of%20the%20Elk.md)

thick wall of brambles gives way to a clearing
dominated by large stone structures, ruined.
western face 300+ft across, 100ft tall
side facing the clearing carved like an elk, antlers drooping down to frame a 50ft cave entrance.
flight of stone steps, old and mossy, leads up to the entrance

50ft oval pool contains water full of algae and plants, few fishies that dont look too good.
verdict: this is a temple of Erastil, the one Jhod Kavken spoke of.

we prepare to confront the maybe-bear guardian and approach the cave.

inside we see the glowing eyes of a bear-shaped creature, half natural half undead.
it maybe tries to speak, but can only growl
hide tangled with leaves and bark, dragging roots behind him.
combat!

as the bear falls, it sighs and its head collapses, transforming into a super old human man, who crumbles into a skeleton and then a pile of dust.
the shrine magically restores itself, becoming once more a sacred temple.

izaya drinks some of the now crystal-clear water. it heals her! equivalent to a moderate healing potion, 3d8+10

we patch our wounds.

we explore the temple.
if we took the time to dig, we'd probably find treasure.
in the cave is an altar to Erastil, next to where the guardian was.
anything else was pillaged long ago.

We decide to head back quickly and swing by the radish field on the way.
## Pharast 23
we arrive at [GB 4 - Moon Radishes](../Places/Stolen%20Lands/Greenbelt/GB%204%20-%20Moon%20Radishes.md)
we find kobolds noshing on radishes again.
Veris will have to take point here. Izaya hands him the silvertongue mutagen she'd bought before leaving.
they seem upset that we're here, and shake their weapons at us.
they accuse us of stealing radishes (of course, we're not stealing radishes). every time they come here, there are fewer and fewer of them.
they call us "gremlins", say we're all the same: pointy ears, smooth skin. they "know" we're stealing.
gremlins steal their statue, their radishes, their trees.
suspicion: the mitflits from [GB 14 - Mitflit Tree](../Places/Stolen%20Lands/Greenbelt/GB%2014%20-%20Mitflit%20Tree.md)?
statue of Old Sharptooth, somethingsomething spirits from sootscale
shaman tartuk is helping them fight gremlins, protect cave&radishes.
is the stolen tree the one in gb14? yes. the tree is shaman tartuk's old home. chief sootscale now has the shaman's help to take back the statue and end gremlins.
izaya suggests that she can summon a mitflit so the kobolds can say whether that's the kind of gremlin that is messing with them. they don't want that.
we suggest: those gremlins were mean to us also. we don't like them. ally?
they say: if we help against gremlins, we can have some radishes. but they have to talk to chief sootscale first.
will we go in and kill all the gremlins? we'll fight them, but if they run away we won't pursue too far.
they accept this. we can take some radishes, and should talk to chief sootscale when we can. tell him Maduk sent us.
## Pharast 24
we return to Oleg's.

we hand over the radishes to svetlana. she pauses and lights up with joy. we get paid 15 gp, and we can have moon radish soup for supper now.

we also tell Jhod Kavken that we found the temple. he's grateful and offers us spellcasting services (primal up to 2nd level).

+40 quest xp, up to 190.

we can/will stock up on equipment in preparation for our attack on the mitflits.
