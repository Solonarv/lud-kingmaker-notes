Veris tries to disable the traps across the chasm. He fails and falls, but grabs an edge.
We string a rope across so the rest of us can cross more easily, and arrive in the mitflits' war room.

on a table: map, pretty accurate, region of old sycamore + sootscale caves. around it, some bits of treasure: a piece of paper (undercommon), little statue of a crouching winged kobold w/ very long horns, a burlap sack with 12 spearheads, 193 cp, 120 sp, 8 gp.

the statue is the one we were looking for.

linzi speaks undercommon. the paper is labeled "them", "us" in two columns. magic dust, coins, human ring; spears, coins. low-level language, not fluent. inventory sheet?

veris asks why they're here. linzi: tartuccio brought us here, said he had arranged meeting w/ mitflits. they were trying to broker a conflict w/ the kobolds. he didn't come, and when they showed up, the mitflits jumped them and took them hostage. Izaya: yeah we know where he is (insert info).

the ladies' gear: not here. but linzi is nervous; she'd rather just leave. amiri needs her sword back. valerie has the borrowed rapier.

after some discussion, we agree: ducim will try to coerce the mitflits into letting us recover the captives' gear. He succeeds amazingly. Linzi sweeps in to communicate our demands (namely: they want their stuff back). however, the mighty sorcerer took it. the sorcerer is around their height, very purple, human-ish sorta like linzi, but with bigger nose and beard and kinda bald.

We leave. We walk away a bit and patch up our wounds, then make camp.

We arrive at [GB 8 - Sootscale Cave](../Places/Stolen%20Lands/Greenbelt/GB%208%20-%20Sootscale%20Cave.md) again. Elphira gives some of her rations to Linzi, Amiri, and Valerie.

tale:
LAV came down the river and through the mountains, trusting tartuccio to not be completely awful (but he was). eventually arrived at kobold mines. tartuccio always made his decisions and met people alone. they felt like they didn't have a choice regarding this, particularly given their isolation.
they didn't get much exploring done here, instead were very busy acting as tartuccio's henchmen up until they got captured.

we find chief sootscale again. Izaya gives him the statue we found. He examines it for a while, then shrieks and smashes it on the floor, grinning. He thanks us for freeing them from the curse and announces that it's time to go kill the usurper.

Izaya stops him, points out LAV: he betrayed them and took their stuff, too.

We go confront Tartuk/Tartuccio, leaving only Linzi behind.

combat!

> In addition, the pile contains 320 cp, 42 sp, 12 gp, two sleep arrows, {a +1 weapon potency runestone - doesn't exist, get 35 gp instead}, and a soiled leather bag. Inside the bag are the treasures stolen from the mitflits. The leather bag contains 21 sp, 9 gp, 1 pp, one dose of dust of appearance, and a plain brass wedding ring set with a single pearl—worth 12 gp as an item of jewelry. Tartuk’s personal journal, written in Undercommon, sits on a table here as well.
