we awaken not in our beds but in a separate sanctum in the manor, with a few other injured guards.  
it's been some time

we're all together though

ducim flags down one of the nearby clerics, a leshy

lady aldori is fine

3 days since the attack

most adventuring parties have left, a few remained and are investigating in Restov

lady aldori supposes this might have been to dissuade her push into the stolen lands

we get out of bed, clean ourselves, and get our gear back on before going to speak with lady aldori

we ask the leshy cleric where lady aldori might be (her study, probably) and thank them for the care.

we head off and indeed find lady aldori in her study. full of trophies and books, a show of power as much as a personal sanctum. she's poring over manuscripts, putting down her signature on a pile of parchments; presumably her concessions to the adventuring parties. she's wearing little pince-nez spectacles.

she thanks us for our intervention there, which apparently was indeed useful. she'd let us have our pick from the bodies, but other adventurers have already had a go; instead she gives us a reward: four little bags. 50 gp and 2x healing potion (lesser), each.

it's fortunate we woke when we did: at noon (it's now 8:15) she'll be handing out charters in a ceremony.

Aerwynn goes to find Linzi; she's in the library. She's reading through manuscripts on legends of the Stolen Lands. She's been thinking about the attack. Thinks it's weird, like there's something everyone's missing. Her bet is on Pitax. Aerwynn says he trusts her intuition and that she should keep looking into it. She suggests exchanging letters, though has doubts about the postal service. Aerwynn: I'm a wizard, Linzi!

Veris goes to buy thieves' tools in case they're needed. also buys:
 - a horse
 - a cart
 - 5 weeks of horse feed
 - 5 weeks of rations for himself

we actually all buy 5wks of rations.

Izaya also goes shopping.... mostly just window shopping, though. She'll buy something in the afternoon, probably. (OOC: we put off purchasing decisions for between sessions)

Izaya tracks down Amiri, finds her sitting on a stone sharpening her big sword. Lets her know we made it through alright in the end, gets taken for drinks at a very flammable-looking watering hole, swaps tales over drinks.

We name the horse "Lady Jessica Hands".

We all gather in the main hall for the noon announcements. It's been repaired, and quickly; everything pristine, no signs of conflict. We immediately see both Iron Wraiths, and the eight NPCs we talked to at the feast earlier. Overall, fewer people than we saw at the feast, though there are a few newcomers.

Lady Jamandi Aldori steps up; the atmosphere turns regal and somber.

thanks those who helped defeat the black tears attack. it's obvious someone doesnt like our plans to settle the stolen lands but were not so easily dissuaded. this morning i'll issue charters to all of you so we can bring civilization, peace, etc to the lands for tomorrow's settlers.
 - first charter: iron wraiths. Glenebon Uplands. deal with tiger lords, establish a base for brevoy, dipl relations with pitax from a pt of strength. one whispers: "bet 30g those other adventurers won't last a fortnight"
 - baron Hannis Drelev: charter extra important. Securing the southern trade routes along the East Sellen River and establishing a base for merchant caravans and barges alike. Hooktongue Slough will be his base of operations. nobleman we haven't seen before. he makes very little sound.
 - maegar varn: his father was a long faithful friend to the Aldori. he goes to Nomen Heights (mountains above Lake Silverstep), to broker an alliance with the centaurs. also maybe eventually establish an aldori dueling school there. he wants us to contact him for trade relations once we're set up.
 - lastly, us, the primary heroes of the current conflict: thanks for risking your. SW, greenbelt region, incl. Narlmarches and Kamelands (which are hill country). bandits in the greenbelt, get rid of them. small trading post in restov hinterlands (Oleg's trading post), suggests we start there. then can talk about a more permanent charter.
 - but there is one more charter still: to the sorcerer tartuccio, deal with a matter of great importance regarding a kobold population in the region. they may very well be a danger to any possible settlements in the area. also in the greenbelt, so he'll work closely with our brigade; she trusts there will be no complications between us? He snickers and boasts that he'll have his own kingdom before we're done wrestling in the dirt with bandits. Linzi has the decency to look embarrassed. We shoot him eye-rolls and harsh whispers, but he persists.

tartuccio's group: ducim knows the kobold population is a big problem; they occupy a lot of mines (esp. silver mines). Tartuccio will have to try and either get the kobolds to sell out or steal their shit. They seem to worship something, nobody's sure quite what, but there are some records of fiendish activity among them.
