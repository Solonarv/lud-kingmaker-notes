piper switch char, away from aerwynn
halfelf warpriest cleric, [[Elphira Highgate]]

aerwynn's rich father was able to get him back into magic school (he had been expelled in backstory). a missive arrives at oleg's informing him of this, alongside elphira.

it'll take us two days to get to the bandit camp.

fewer and fewer outposts of civ as we go on, more and more wilderness. eventually we reach the banks of the thorn river. eventually we find a path/trail leading into a clearing.

light (campfire) on other side of little stream, voices chatting. time of day: evening. looks like perhaps five people in the clearing, could be more outside

we could easily jump over the stream at various locations

V&D notice a platform in a tree where a bandit lookout is posted. he's pretty relaxed but might notice us if we come closer. around 20ft up. ducim tries to sneak up to him for a stealth takedown, but is noticed.
combat!

we have a brief discussion on whether we should let him live. we end up telling him to fuck off and go straight, after izaya checks that he can't give us any further help against the stag lord

we take kressle's stuff, and the bandits':
 - kressle:
	 - lesser healing pot
	 - silver stag lord amulet (3 gp)
	 - 8 gp 5 sp
 - bandits: stuff and things
> The banditsâ€™ spoils are hidden under mundane supplies like food, firewood, and tents beneath the platform at area B2. Their stash currently includes 9 gp, 121 sp, a pair of silver earrings worth 15 gp, a wooden music box worth 8 gp, three crates of furs and pelts worth 5 gp per crate, and 8 bottles of herbal liquor, each worth 2 gp.
 
We load up all the stuff onto our cart. money gets split:
total 8+0.5+9+12.1=29.6, split 4 ways: 7.4 gp each

we decide to camp here 
watch:
veris, elphira, ducim, izaya

before leaving in the morning, we bury the four dead bandits in a shallow grave.

we head back to Oleg's, arrive evening. in total we spent 4 days outside the bandit corpses hanging on the walls are quite stinky now.

there are some merchants here, some movement.
we sell to Oleg:
 - silver earrings
 - wooden music box
 - booze
to the merchants:
 - furs
total proceeds: 54 gp, split 4 ways 13.5 each

other things here: oleg set up a board for bounties/requests.
 - sootscale kobolds riled up
 - tuskgutter, big bad boar
 - kill/capture more bandits
 - gather some radishes for svetlana
 - go kill a tatzlwyrm

we head out!

day 1: GB 3. travel. Here are the moon radishes.
day 2: GB 3. travel, look for tatzlwyrm. eventually, Izaya hears something: atop a fir tree are two little nests with small creatures, staring at us and giggling. we stop and call them out. They hide and fly away. We hear a noise from behind us: a low growl.
we can't see the source of the noise. elphira detect magic: yes. veris doesn't know what this is, but Izaya does: a fey prank, probably. Izaya and Veris both speak Sylvan. Izaya addresses them, but they don't show themselves. We continue traveling and continue hearing noises and seeing lights, but we ignore them.
day 3: GB 2. In the morning, we find a human's corpse pinned to the ground by fallen logs, with some items around: a cold iron hatchet, a waterskin, and a backpack with rations, sleeping bag, spool of cord, 2 strips of linen, a few pelts, a skinning knife, a set of leatherworker tools, and materials for three spike snares. we make camp.
day 4: GB 5. here is the source of the skunk river. two little hot-spring ponds smelling like rotten eggs. inhabited by a few giant frogs. we make camp *away* from the ponds.
day 5: GB 11. ground slumps into a proper mire. some ruined stone buildings around.

as we approach this ruined village we notice a slimy frog person come out of one of the buildings. shouting 'truce', we shout back the same.
"me boggart, this slurg". points at the creature besides him. "you go."
after we briefly confer, Izaya tells the boggart our names and asks "we return?". He repeats: "you go." Izaya agrees: "We go."

day 6: GB 16. Long ford with a few islets, some connected by rubble and logs. Natural chokepoint. Inhabited by a few animals. Central island inhabited by two coiled tatzlwyrms, embracing each other with their tiny arms.
