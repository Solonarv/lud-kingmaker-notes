travel for a week, no incidents

we arrive at oleg's trading post, last bastion of cviilization before heading into the stolen lands proper. last place where restov's grasp holds, though we're here to extend that. originally a border fort, has pretty tall walls & decent protection.

human guy calls out to us from top of a watchtower, who goes there? aerwynn introduces us. he lets us in. Oleg Leveton:

he says his wife has food for us: bread, stew, wine. his wife: Svetlana(?). they ask if we're the help they asked for. he seems unhappy about the settlemeny efforts, bt his wife shushes him.

they've been having bandit troubles, sent a messenger to restov - but only a few days ago, i.e. after we left.

bandits will come in the morning to demand "tax"

bandits have been here for ~3 months, threatened to burn down post; oleg&wife weren't sure what to do yet, so just paid up. they returned on the first of each month demanding more. suspects their camp is close, less than a day's ride.

bandits first showed up with a dozen or so members, plus two leaders. leaders: man in a cloak, with a bow; lady with two hatchets, seemed sharp. he seemed less so, bit dim. (veris designates both as leads). she did most of the talking. also, she took Svetlana's wedding, but didn't return the next time.

second and third visits had six then four bandits, maybe even fewer tomorrow?

aerwynn asks why oleg doesn't like the settlement efforts: just bringing more trouble, more big city politics, which they were trying to get away from in the first place.

he suggests that we hide during the night to ambush the bandits; he and his wife aren't soldiers.

tells us they have some other guests, traders. wants to be kept abrest of our plans. we thank them for the meal

plan: aerwynn and izaya wait on the walkway at the top of the log palisade, prone so we aren't seen from outside. ducim and veris hide in or behind other buildings. when the bandits enter, aerwynn will grease the entrance and we will begin fighting. we leave the entrance closed, but not locked.

next morning, the bandits arrive, about 1h after sunrise. 4 in total. on horseback. the hooded man with bow&arrow shouts to open the gate, else fire. oleg complies and steps back. this is when we spring our trap.

combat time!

combat ends, we win. xp += 90, new total: 750/1000

weather: chilly, but no precipitation.

loot:
 - mundane crap
 - a composite shortbow: ducim takes it
 - an amulet.

Izaya (with no help from Veris) coerces the captured bandit into spilling what he knows.
 - he mentions a "kressoe", who'll get revenge, come for us sooner rather than later. presumably the bandits' leader.
 - where's their camp? south, on the thorn river, says we don't stand a chance against the folks there. (hex GB7)
 - how many? 7-8 if we're lucky, upwards of 20 if we aren't. it's just them, kressoe, and ~10 others who live there. the rest wander a bit.
 - how fortified? some watchposts in the trees, nothing like this place of "ours". they "don't need to hide behind walls."
 - who else do the people in that camp prey on? any kind of civ this side of the greenbelt.
 - who's the Stag Lord? more monster than man. calls himself that, deadeye with a bow, once crushed a prisoner's hand to mush with one fist. wears a weird creepy stag helmet, our guy thinks that's his face.
 - what do you think of the staglord? he's a drunk, but the pay's good and our guy's not about to defy orders. SL is half of what he used to be, but never was quite right in the head.
 - who's axe gal? kressoe. she's the boss (of our guy's outfit), though she has ambitions of usurping the stag lord. SL spends more money on booze than on outfitting the bandits under him.
 - does he know of any other bands under the SL? no, SL is pretty secretive. there's a secret passphrase to get into the fort: "By the bloody bones of Saint Gilmorg, who wants to know?" NE shore of the tuskwater (hex TW3)
 - he takes out an amulet: an open-faced helmet made from a predator skull with extra antlers. says: this thing is another identifier we use, if passwords don't do.

meanwhile, oleg, ducim, and veris string up the dead bandits outside the palisade.

after asking svetlana, izaya quarters the prisoner in the stables for now, and tries to treat his wounds a bit... but she fucks it up and kills him. he also gets strung up outside.

after izaya asks, oleg says he's more concerned about scaring away bandits than traders at the moment.

oleg is willing to buy our stuff at full price. the trading post has a few trade goods for sale; also healing pots, antidotes, arrows, rations, water, other such sundries.

next session plan: go to the bandit camp, scout it out, if we think we can take it: go in blasting!
