## Setup
we were all invited to restov by [Jamandi Aldori](../NPCs/Jamandi%20Aldori.md), swordlord
she wants to expand her influence into the stolen lands
"call for heroes"
attempt to expand Brevoy into the river kingdoms

Verissian knows: one of the main opponents is king [Castruccio Irovetti](../NPCs/Castruccio%20Irovetti.md), ruler of Pitax south of the stolen lands. tyrannical government, suppresses arts/culture, ruled by a petty despot.

## Outside
we arrive at [Jamandi Aldori](../NPCs/Jamandi%20Aldori.md)'s manor, very regal. dozens of heroes, mercenaries, local nobles etc here besides us.
very impressive hilltop manor
few 100m cobblestone path leads there from the city itself
decorated with statues(?) of creatures (dragon, tarrasque, etc)
passing guard barracks, stables, servant housing,...

manor is big, sprawling, light gray stone, rose gardens.
to Izaya's eyes: more of a "nouveau riche" sort of nice. house is pretty modern.

starting to get dark already, skies threatening to rain.

### Descriptions
[Verissian Laurentine](../Player%20Characters/Verissian%20Laurentine.md) (description) looks bored, but doesn't dare complain

[Ducim Nogleshbesmar](../Player%20Characters/Ducim%20Nogleshbesmar.md) average height for a dwarf, shortish beard (reddish), practicality over fashion, nice well-groomed handlebar mustache. bronzish tanned skin. practical/functional clothes, clearly been mended and re-mended. tattered black cloak. sheathed beeg (executioner's) sword with markings on the hilt.

[Aerwynn Goldmoon](../Player%20Characters/Aerwynn%20Goldmoon.md) pretty short male elf. impeccably tailored clothes, hair beautifully brushed: very concerned about his appearance. has a big spellbook and a backpack. looks very concerned about possible rain.

[Izaya Surtova](../Player%20Characters/Izaya%20Surtova.md) description

we slowly move along the line

we're the last.

the line is sooooo sloooooow
## Feast Leadup
eventually a servant calls for us and lets us in.

just as we start getting in we feel the first raindrops start to fall.

hall prepared for a great impressive feat
servants 
armed house guard positioned against east/west walls which lead further into the manor
north: big roaring fireplace
2 massivechandeliers on the ceiling
nymphs satyrs fae frolocking on wall murals
9 tables in central portion of the room
lots of adventurers all over
no food yet, plenty of drinks
smell of spices and roasted meats but not here yet
we're guided in until we're seated at our table(s)

at a nearby table there are the Iron Wraiths. Ducim knows about them: big famous adventuring party, known for always wearing full-body armor and never showing any skin. One of them is Large. started off as a warlord band in Numeria. They'll probably be competition.

we introduce ourselves.

ducim asks: why are we here?
 - aerwynn: new start with (pulls out fox creature)
 - veris: must everyone have some grand reason?
 - Izaya: following in the footsteps of my grandfather

iron wraiths seem to have some disdain for all these "no-name" adventurers

other people at our table are talking

small girl with big muscles (Amiri): who the hell are the aldori anyway?
gnome staring at everyone else like he is better than them (because he is)

halfling lady with very nice braided hair, trying to eavesdrop on us.
Aewrynn adresses her: who are you?
storyteller, Linzi
she's hoping to chronicle this whole thing
she knows stuff about the big scary guy at the other table
suspects: big guy actually a minotaur, without horns
leader: leni strelev?
rumor: ex hell knights
slain dragons
saved kingdoms
they have an oracle; she points and gets a stare in return. Izaya points out that's rude and fails to demonstrate better.

as we banter, two figures enter: pretty half-elf woman with sword and armor ([Jamandi Aldori](../NPCs/Jamandi%20Aldori.md)) and an older guy with robe&staff ([Josef Stolemius](../NPCs/Josef%20Stolemius.md)). Ducim mistakes josef for [Castruccio Irovetti](../NPCs/Castruccio%20Irovetti.md).

Josef speaks first. greetings heroes. I am lord mayof of restov and this is lady jamandi aldori. thx all for attending.
jamandi takes his place. south of here are stolen lands. territory claimed over and over by various settlers, but area is a haven for bandits, monsters, and worse, so has never been held. this will now change.
offer: go down there, pacify/colonize. support of restov: recognition, trade, military aid.
she raises her glass to us and bids the feast begin. servants come in bringing food&drink.

we remember nothing of note about jamandi.

## The Feast
Influence subsystem go! 20 minutes per round.
### Round 1
Veris is curious about a deathly pale elf in pale clothing (no jewelry, massive scythe) next to him.  He learns nothing.

Ducim tries to learn about a woman in plate armor with a big sword and short blonde hair. He learns that she's best influenced via diplomacy.

Aerwynn chats up the halfling storyteller. She talks about her favorite artists and performers. She asks about his favorite instrument(s): harps! she's actually trained, learned at Pitax U before, you know,... She offers to play and Aerwynn accepts! she plays very well, a traditional halfling tune from Pitax. Aerwynn asks if she knows any elf songs, though he knows it's a stretch. She botches it this time, but Aerwynn tries to be polite about it.

Izaya tries to get to know Amiri. She seems somewhat confused about what's going on, not very well-informed about what exactly this call for heroes entails. Lowest influence DC: athletics. Very willing to listen though.

### Round 2
Veris tries turning up the charm on the edgy elf lady. It doesn't really work.

Ducim continues to try and suss out the Brienne expy's weak points. She might be receptive to intimidation(!?).

Aerwynn continues talking to Linzi, trying to see if she knows anything about the strange woman a couple tables over. He tries do this in a sneaky and conspiratorial way, but she's not buying it and rebukes him.

Izaya preys on Amiri's confusion: she answers her questions, engaging with her and explaining what the Aldori's deal is.

### Round 3
Veris abandons the edgy elf lady for a lost cause and turns his attention on the grumpy gnome. He learns that he'd be most receptive to influence via deception.

Ducim sharpens his sword, trying to appear menacing to appeal to the Brienne expy. She raises an eyebrow and asks if he wants to speak to her. She tells him off for sharpening his sword and thinking that's a good social move, which he concedes. They exchange names: she's Valerie. She's originally from Brevoy, but hasn't been home in quite some time. 
Ducim hails from Numeria in the west. She's unimpressed. Ducim is starting to realize he may have misjudged his approach and leaves her alone.

Aerwynn scooches up toward the gnome. He's wearing fairly nice, fine clothes. Aerwynn asks him about his clothes; he demurrs. Aerwynn insists: "compared to the rabble around here, we're the best dressed." He's from ?? and called ??. His magical talent is innate and doesn't require training. Gnomeguy: what else should I know about (the other people at the table) besides that they're unworthy to rule the Stolen Lands.

Izaya continues trying to befriend Amiri, telling adventure stories from grandpa and listening to the story of how Amiri killed encroaching frost giants with her bare hands and their own swords before taking one of their swords for her own. Amiri seems a bit miffed at Izaya's (unspoken, unintended) implication that grandpa Tanako's stories might be more impressive than Amiri's.

### Round 4
Veris approaches Valerie, who seems less annoyed than she was by Ducim's antics (not a high bar). She asks if Veris is also here to bring some law to the Stolen Lands, or just here to watch. Veris: why come here if not to do something? They exchange names. The festivities are nice enough, but she wishes there were something more practical to do. Veris drinks to that. She's on the lookout for familiar faces, hasn't spotted any, and would rather it stay that way. Why is Veris here? personal interest, familial connection, a mix. Valerie: someone has to bring law and order, might as well be me. She tries to recruit him, and he politely demurrs.

Ducim tries to find out how to approach the other dwarf at the table. It's Groetus lore: the man's faithful.

Aerwynn buries his distaste and tries to get into the good graces of Mr Superiority Complex the Gnome again. He doesn't buy it.

Izaya tries to schmooze up to the gnome guy by pretending to share his better-than-everyone belief. It helps that his superiority complex is fueled by his innate/sorcerous spellcasting, which Izaya shares. He's so impressed he gives her a beautiful brooch of shielding, which she tucks away reverently while thanking him. They exchange names; he's Tartuccio.

### Round 5
Veris observes the black-clad human and gets no read.

Ducim goes for the gnome, trying to stare him down while visibly fondling his sword. The gnome pretends (not very successfully) to not be affected. Ducim talks about all the limitations of spellcasting and tries to knock down the guy's superiority complex. Ducim goes all the way to threatening a duel, but the gnome demurrs, noting that Lady Aldori probably wouldn't appreciate a dead guest.

Aerwynn tries to win back Linzi's favor with an apology, sweetened by a gift of a healing potion. She awkwardly accepts it, not really sure what to do, and gifts him two talismans in return (which Aerwynn gratefully accepts): a jade cat and an onyx panther.

Izaya chats up the human. We exchange names: he's Maegar Varn. Izaya doesn't recognize the name. He's a swordlord by trade, noble by birth. He's already been assigned to (somewhere, name?) and asks if Izaya has been (no, still waiting). They toast and seem to part on good terms.

### Round 6
Veris continues chatting to Valerie. She asks if Veris follows any gods. He turns the question around: once, she was, but nowadays it's a bit difficult. She's not fully comfortable speaking about it.

Aerwynn tries to chat up the edgy elf lady, asking her if she happens to be a magic user: yes, a little bit, but she doesn't think it relevant. The scythe is a weapon of her goddess, a matter of religion.

Izaya talks to the dwarf at the other end of the table. He asks what her problem is: only that he's the one person at this table she hasn't spoken to! He accepts this, stating that one should know one's drinking buddies with the apocalypse coming any day now. They chat about trying to make the most of life before it ends (sooner than expected!), exchange names (he's Harrim), and motivations for going into the Stolen Lands (he's trying to see if he can find any of the dwarven ruins that are rumored to be there before Groetus ends the world).

Ducim continues trying to intimidate Tartuccio into not being an asshole.

### Verdict
 - Amiri: Human, female. barbarian (obviously), respects strength, doesn't understand politics very well. Friendly-then-awkward with Izaya.
 - Valerie: Human, female. (former?) cleric? of some deity. Really into law and order, wants to bring some to the Stolen Lands. Friendly with Veris, doesn't like Ducim (because of the sword intimidation stunt).
 - Maegar Varn: Human, male. Swordlord by trade, noble by birth. Already assigned to Nomen Heights by Lady Aldori. Friendly with Izaya. He proposes that she might visit Nomen Heights sometime.
 - Harrim: Dwarf, male. cleric of Groetus. Heading to the Stolen Lands in search of rumored dwarven ruins. Waiting for the apocalypse. Friendly with Izaya.
 - Tartuccio: Gnome, male. Innate/spontaneous spellcaster of some kind (sorcerer? psychic? who knows) and thinks this makes him superior to everyone. Friendly with Izaya, because he thinks she agrees with him and is also a spellcaster of the same description. Less friendly with Aerwynn (whose attempts at schmoozing he saw through) and Ducim (who just tried to batter down his superiority complex with a dose of reality)!
 - Unnamed elf lady: Elf, female. Follower of some goddess, scythe-wielder, some magic. OOC: goddess is probably Urgathoa (one of the few goddesses with a scythe favored weapon), she's probably a champion.
 - Linzi: halfling, female. Bard/storyteller. Curious about the party and on good-ish terms with Aerwynn (there was some awkwardness but it was sorta smoothed over).

## Jamandi's Speech
around 9-10 in the evening
heavy rain outside

Jamandi rises, says she hopes we all enjoyed the feast. You honor me, but this night is dedicated to you. I can't wait to hear of your exploits in the Stolen Lands. Tomorrow I will assign you your territories. Make an early night of it, meet here tmrw at sunrise. She has prepared bedchambers for us all, which house guards will escort us to.

Maegar Varn excuses himself, as he has business in the city.

The Iron Wraiths are sleeping elsewhere.

Many (party included) gratefully accept the hospitality, if only to not have to trudge back through the rain.

We're all led into pretty nice rooms into the east wing - the four of us in the same room. There are guards posted outside.
