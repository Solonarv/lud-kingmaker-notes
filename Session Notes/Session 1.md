## Setup
we were all invited to restov by [[jamandi aldori]], swordlord
she wants to expand her influence into the stolen lands
"call for heroes"
attempt to expand Brevoy into the river kingdoms

Verissian knows: one of the main opponents is king ?? who rules [[pitax]], south of the stolen lands. tyrannical government, suppresses arts/culture, rules by a despot.

## Outside
we arrive at [[jamandi aldori]]'s manor, very regal. dozens of heroes, mercenaries, local nobles etc here besides us.
very impressive hilltop manor
few 100m cobblestone path leads there from the city itself
decorated with statues(?) of creatures (dragon, tarrasque, etc)
passing guard barracks, stables, servant housing,...

manor is big, sprawling, light gray stone, rose gardens.
to Izaya's eyes: more of a "nouveau riche" sort of nice. house is pretty modern.

starting to get dark already, skies threatening to rain.

### Descriptions
veris (description) looks bored, but doesn't dare complain

[[../Player Characters/Ducim Nogleshbesmar]] average height for a dwarf, shortish beard (reddish), practicality over fashion, nice well-groomed handlebar mustache. bronzish tanned skin. practical/functional clothes, clearly been mended and re-mended. tattered black cloak. sheathed beeg (executioner's) sword with markings on the hilt.

[[../Player Characters/Aerwynn Goldmoon]] pretty short male elf. impeccably tailored clothes, hair beautifully brushed: very concerned about his appearance. has a big spellbook and a backpack. looks very concerned about possible rain.

[[../Build Planning/Izaya]] description

we slowly move along the line

we're the last.

sloooooow
## Feast Leadup
eventually a servant calls for us and lets us in.

just as we start getting in we feel the first raindrops start to fall.

hall prepared for a great impressive feat
servants 
armed house guard positioned against east/west walls which lead further into the manor
north: big roaring fireplace
2 massivechandeliers on the ceiling
nymphs satyrs fae frolocking on wall murals
9 tables in central portion of the room
lots of adventurers all over
no food yet, plenty of drinks
smell of spices and roasted meats but not here yet
we're guided in until we're seated at our table(s)

at a nearby table there are the Iron Wraiths. Ducim knows about them: big famous adventuring party, known for always wearing full-body armor and never showing any skin. One of them is Large. started off as a warlord band in Numeria. They'll probably be competition.

we introduce ourselves.

ducim asks: why are we here?
 - aerwynn: new start with (pulls out fox creature)
 - veris: must everyone have some grand reason?
 - Izaya: following in the footsteps of my grandfather

iron wraiths seem to have some disdain for all these "no-name" adventurers

other people at our table are talking

small girl with big muscles (Amiri): who the hell are the aldori anyway?
gnome staring at everyone else like he is better than them (because he is)

halfling lady with very nice braided hair, trying to eavesdrop on us.
Aewrynn adresses her: who are you?
storyteller, Linzi
she's hoping to chronicle this whole thing
she knows stuff about the big scary guy at the other table
suspects: big guy actually a minotaur, without horns
leader: leni strelev?
rumor: ex hell knights
slain dragons
saved kingdoms
they have an oracle; she points and gets a stare in return. Izaya points out that's rude and fails to demonstrate better.

as we banter, two figures enter: pretty half-elf woman with sword and armor ([[jamandi aldori]]) and older guy with robe&staff (josef stolemius, human male, lord mayor of restov). Ducim mistakes josef for king of pitax.

man speaks first. greetings heroes. I am lord mayof of restov and this is lady jamandi aldori. thx all for attending.
jamandi takes his place. south of here are stolen lands. territory claimed over and over by various settlers, but area is a haven for bandits, monsters, and worse, so has never been held. this will now change.
offer: go down there, pacify/colonize. support of restov: recognition, trade, military aid.
she raises her glass to us and bids the feast begin. servants come in bringing food&drink.

we remember nothing of note about jamandi.

influence minigame begin! 20 minutes per round.

### Round 1
Veris is curious about a deathly pale elf in pale clothing (no jewelry, massive scythe) next to him.  He learns nothing.

Ducim tries to learn about a woman in plate armor with a big sword and short blonde hair. He learns that she's best influenced via diplomacy.

Aerwynn chats up the halfling storyteller. She talks about her favorite artists and performers. She asks about his favorite instrument(s): harps! she's actually trained, learned at Pitax U before, you know,... She offers to play and Aerwynn accepts! she plays very well, a traditional halfling tune from Pitax. Aerwynn asks if she knows any elf songs, though he knows it's a stretch. She botches it this time, but Aerwynn tries to be polite about it.

Izaya tries to get to know Amiri. She seems somewhat confused about what's going on, not very well-informed about what exactly this call for heroes entails. Lowest influence DC: athletics. Very willing to listen though.

### Round 2
Veris tries turning up the charm on the edgy elf lady. It doesn't really work.

Ducim continues to try and suss out the Brienne expy's weak points. She might be receptive to intimidation(!?).

Aerwynn continues talking to Linzi, trying to see if she knows anything about the strange woman a couple tables over. He tries do this in a sneaky and conspiratorial way, but she's not buying it and rebukes him.

Izaya preys on Amiri's confusion: she answers her questions, engaging with her and explaining what the Aldori's deal is.

### Round 3
Veris abandons the edgy elf lady for a lost cause and turns his attention on the grumpy gnome. He learns that he'd be most receptive to influence via deception.

Ducim sharpens his sword, trying to appear menacing to appeal to the Brienne expy. She raises an eyebrow and asks if he wants to speak to her. She tells him off for sharpening his sword and thinking that's a good social move, which he concedes. They exchange names: she's Valerie. She's originally from Brevoy, but hasn't been home in quite some time. 
Ducim hails from Numeria in the west. She's unimpressed. Ducim is starting to realize he may have misjudged his approach and leaves her alone.

Aerwynn scooches up toward the gnome. He's wearing fairly nice, fine clothes. Aerwynn asks him about his clothes; he demurrs. Aerwynn insists: "compared to the rabble around here, we're the best dressed." He's from ?? and called ??. His magical talent is innate and doesn't require training. Gnomeguy: what else should I know about (the other people at the table) besides that they're unworthy to rule the Stolen Lands.

Izaya continues trying to befriend Amiri, telling adventure stories from grandpa and listening to the story of how Amiri killed encroaching frost giants with her bare hands and their own swords before taking one of their swords for her own. Amiri seems a bit miffed at Izaya's (unspoken, unintended) implication that grandpa Tanako's stories might be more impressive than Amiri's.

### Round 4
Veris approaches Valerie, who seems less annoyed than she was by Ducim's antics (not a high bar). She asks if Veris is also here to bring some law to the Stolen Lands, or just here to watch. Veris: why come here if not to do something? They exchange names. The festivities are nice enough, but she wishes there were something more practical to do. Veris drinks to that. She's on the lookout for familiar faces, hasn't spotted any, and would rather it stay that way. Why is Veris here? personal interest, familial connection, a mix. Valerie: someone has to bring law and order, might as well be me. She tries to recruit him, and he politely demurrs.

Ducim

Aerwynn

Izaya tries to schmooze up to the gnome guy by pretending to share his better-than-everyone belief.
