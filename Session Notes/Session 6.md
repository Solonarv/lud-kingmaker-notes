It is revealed that these enemies were level 2 and 3. 140 XP, levelup with 10 leftover!

We set up camp and find some skeletal remains
> The skeleton wears a suit of ruined scale mail and clutches a +1 cold iron longsword in one bony hand.
> Additional treasure is revealed in the form of a rotting leather backpack that contains 12 gp, 62 sp, a pewter drinking stein worth 2 gp, a silver ring worth 7 gp, a jade carving of a female elf worth 11 gp, and a watertight scroll tube that contains a map.
> The explorer had been working to create a map of the northwest corner of the Greenbelt, so the PCs can use it to help with Map the Area individual hexploration activities of any hex in Rostland or the Greenbelt; doing so grants a +2 item bonus to Survival checks made to Map the Area.

day 7

we set off, to TW 1, where we explore. The river makes a sharp bend here, into a deep pool fringed by reeds and covered in lilypads. freshly felled trees around. no activity at the moment though.
there is a trail leading east (toward TW3 via TW 2).

day 8: we continue to TW 2.
there's an abandoned camp here. some supplies. an expedition, perhaps. abandoned for a few weeks, ish. we poke around. there are some hasty scribblings, decent amount of food (no meat!), some abstract-looking paintings. the scribblings are in gnomish, Izaya can read them: complicated subjects!
 - the basics: this was a gnomish exploration/surveying group, looking for evidence of some mystical magical influence. stolen lands might be related to some ancestral tales of the gnomish people.

elphira pulses detect magic a bit: nothing

day 9: we veer north, into GB 18 avoiding the Stag Lord's fort in TW 3
long valley between 2 hills, populated by various thickets of raspberry-like fruit draped with the gossamer silk of spiderwebs. thickets are very spiky and thorny.

Izaya summons a sprite to scout. It flies forward and grasps one of the raspberry-like fruit. Immediately a bunch of spiders the size of a human thumb, with large serrated fangs, start crawling out of the brambles. the sprite disappears and the spiders remain upset.

day 10: to GB 13. we have to figure out how to cross the thorn river. rickety wooden bridge winds across a 20 ft gorge between rocky hills.

izaya summons a sprite again, a different one. she asks it to tie the rope around a large boulder on the other side, as an extra guardrail on the bridge. It complies and Izaya crosses, though the bridge creaks ominously. Veris follows, same result. â€” LOL NOPE WE HAVE A CART

we decide to look for another crossing and head south, to...

day 11: GB 19 thorn river grows shallower here, with a ford no deeper than 3 ft which we can cross. 

day 12: GB 14. looming over a hill is a graying hulk of a sycamore tree, 100 ft tall, seems to be dying, visible for miles around. around it are mitflits, gremlins who spend their days perfecting pranks and playing with oversized vermin. they're armed.

Izaya knows: they're a type of gremlin, lost most of their magic, find companionship with vermin/rats/centipedes/worms etc. often live underground. cruel fey tricksters.

We go around and avoid the mitflits.

day 13: GB 8 rocky crag in the hills, small crack at base (5 ft wide). we notice that this opens (downward, 20 ft) into a crevice that widens into a cave, which sparkles slightly. Ducim (because he's a dwarf) identifies it as probably a gold vein.
We use a rope to go down. Cave goes deep into the bowels of the earth. Definitely precious metals here, an open vein of gold. No signs of habitation or exploitation. We ponder how this might be.
Elphira detects magic: nothing.
We go back up and Izaya casts ghost sound at the bottom of the crevice (max volume) to see if anything shows up. Some figures do show up, small and hunched-over.
Izaya has darkvision and can see: they're small lizardlike creatures riding a giant ant. They're kobolds.

We decide to try and see if they speak common (or any other languages we speak), next session.
