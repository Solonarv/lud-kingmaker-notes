We start shouting variants on "hello, can you understand us?" in all the languages we know. They respond with clicking noises and snarls (clearly language though).

We shrug and leave, hoping to return with an ability to understand them.

day 14: GB 4, moon radishes
there are four kobolds here, sleeping (they've clearly eaten a lot of radishes, and have basketfuls left)
verissian tries to harvest more radishes without waking the kobolds. they're light sleepers, and wake up.
they get up and start snarling+screaming
charade communication: we would like to peacefully harvest some radishes. â€” no! is theirs! go 'way (waves spear threateningly)
ducim tries to coerce kob 4 into letting us harvest some radishes. kob 4 is cowed and steps away.
the others close ranks, however. in the interest of not jeopardizing relations with the sootscale kobs, we decide not to press the issue.
ducim finds us a spot where we can set up camp and watch the kobolds from atop a tree, unseen.
some other kobolds come in, they talk to each other. they fill up some more baskets, taking almost all the radishes, and all start moving away (toward the sootscale cave).

day 15: we decide against harvesting the remaining moon radishes, so as to allow regrowth.
we finally return to Oleg's trading post.
we give Oleg the tatzlwyrm heads; he's impressed, and gives us ten lover's knots in return. we distribute them: 4 to veris, 3 to izaya, 3 to ducim. 20 xp each, up to 30/1000.
changes at OTP:
 - new person at the trading post: group of mercenaries, led by a well-armored well-dressed man. they set up a few tents outside the palisade. helping to guard oleg's trading post.
 - one additional figure, older man with receding hairline and big mustache, dressed in druid's robes.
we crash into bed and decide to talk to them tomorrow.

We go chat to the druid. His name is Jhod Kavken. He seems to have heard about us. he's glad to see us return safely, and is hoping for a favor: he's a worshiper of Erastil (elk father, stag god, one of the first gods of the humans). he has reason to believe that he's been granted a chance to serve Erastil's faith in these lands: been pulled here by a not-dream, a tug south that brought him here from Brevoy. There might be a lost temple to Erastil here, or several. Those would be in the south of the Narlmarches. He has a feeling that this temple may be desecrated, and possibly protected by some sort of guardian - a bear, with something odd about it. He will be staying here while we search for the temple. Imagery is the usual for Erastil: stag, deer, agriculture. Reward (for restoring the temple, not just finding it): spellcasting services. Quite generous of him!

Izaya recognizes the mercenary leader's emblem: the Garess family. there was some scandal involving one of them becoming a mercenary. She walks up to him, says hello, introduces herself. He's Kesten Garess. We're the reason he got this job, guarding the trading post. He has a problem for us to solve: a few months ago he was working with the Varisian mercenary Falgrim Sneeg, a bit down south into Restov. They had an altercation, Sneeg betrayed them and robbed them of a job, then fled deeper into the greenbelt. Seems to have become a bandit of some kind. This was 2-3 months ago. He might've joined up with the Stag Lord. Garess wants to square up this problem, and wants the guy alive. He'll be brought back to Restov where he'll receive proper punishment. If we do this, he can arrange for some special weaponry for us; better steel than one can usually find around here. Sneeg is unlikely to be leading anything, probably part of a larger group. Identifying features: he's Varisian, weird hair color (purple going on gray), long hair, big bushy beard, always very calm; never seemed to change his mood. 

We take a week to rest, recover, and retrain.
Veris: unspecified language (ancient Osirian) -> draconic
