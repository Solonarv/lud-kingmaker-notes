Rocky crag in the hills, at the base of it is a crack in the earth that opens downward. A 20 ft long crevice opens up into a larger cave whose walls glitter with gold and other precious metals.

Cursory investigation (baiting via ghost sound) brought out kobolds looking around the cave. Presumably these are the sootscale kobolds mentioned on the notice board.
