"Elphira was born an embarrassing illegitimate child of Taldan nobles. She was raised discreetly in a church of Pharasma and then quietly exiled at 16. For years she wandered around Chelish and Brevoy struggling to survive, crushed in spirit and faith, until she was found by a retired Crimson Templar in Issia. Reinvigorated in both body and spirit by the word of Ragathiel, she relentlessly trained under the tutelage of the old Templar. Now an adult, she has persistently sought an invite to Lady Jamandi's expedition in hopes of establishing a prolific church of Ragathiel and with it a new court of Crimson Templars."
