Aerwynn is a male Aiudeen Elf of short stature and pale skin. Their soft features and immaculate robes are adorned with all manner of jewelry and gemstones exposing a tendency for meticulous vanity. His familiar, a white ferret named Omen, can often be found draped around his neck. He originally hails from Korvosa where he studied at the famous magical college The Acadamae. During his time there he discovered his knack for all manner of magical crafting, but particularly took to alchemy and runework. These days he harbors no goodwill to his previous home, having been disgraced and expelled from the college under mysterious circumstances. Aerwynn has journeyed to the River Kingdoms in search of a new beginning, hoping to take advantage of the unique academic opportunities in the great unknown of the Stolen Lands and establish a progressive magical college in defiance of The Acadamae.
