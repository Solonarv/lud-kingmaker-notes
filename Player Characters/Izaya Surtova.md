## Backstory
Father (Aliskei) is a distant cousin of King Noleski Surtova, son of the formerly-wandering kitsune swordsman Tanako and Ajtala Surtova.

Izaya's mother, Nawahime (almost surely an assumed name), posed as a visiting noblewoman from far away, seduced Aliskei into a whirlwind romance, and disappeared into the night shortly after giving birth to Izaya.

As Aliskei was only nineteen years old at the time and nobody, including himself, trusted him with raising a child, Izaya was raised in large part in by Aliskei's sister Svatav (who didn't inherit Tanako's kitsune nature) and her grandparents, who also hushed up the affair.

Tanako's former adventurous nature imprinted on her and eventually drove her to the Stolen Lands.

## Appearance
### Tailless form
5'4" / 163 cm tall, 119 lb / 54 kg

23 years old

very pretty woman, enough to turn heads unless she deliberately tones it down

shoulder-length platinum blonde hair, very atypical for a Surtova (same color as grandpa Tanako though).

delicate face with an easy smile, or rather smirk
### True Form
same overall build

fur is white, with green markings on forehead, eartips, forearms

bushy white tail, expressive:
 - stands away and curves upward when interested/attentive
 - lashes back and forth when irritated/playful/excited

## Personality etc
### Sexuality &co
demi-panromantic, homosexual
thinks she would be into casual sex but hasn't had any because of social pressures
actually very cuddly but doesn't get to cuddle very many people, so a bit touch-starved. true form cuddles are extra nice.
### Demeanor
snarky at pretty much everyone, though she keeps it subtle against people she can't afford to piss off
unable to take anything seriously but this is actually just an affectation. developed as a defense mechanism: jokes are a great way to deflect from inquiries into her familial background.
### Secrets
Cautious about her kitsune nature (usually goes around as a human) but takes no great pains to conceal it. As far as she's concerned it's just a neat trick she can do, or so she says.
Secretive about the source of her magics. Takes great trust to reveal aasimar nature or source of sorc powers.
### Religion
Follows the Prismatic Ray (Desna, Shelyn, and Sarenrae), Shelyn in particular. She's a passable painter, but unfortunately doesn't have much time to work on her art.
